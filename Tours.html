        <p>
    With looming cliffs overhead and framed by lodgepole pines and moss-covered boulders, this trail captures all of the area's beauty without the elevation gain. Enjoy a long, leisurely hike, watching the rafters and kayakers pass you by; or park a car at the Lava Lake trailhead and make it a quick one-way. Carry bear spray.</p>

        <br>
    <p>This trail is open year-round, but be careful for high water during runoff season.</p>

    <h3>Directions</h3>
    <p>From Bozeman, take Hwy. 191 south toward Gallatin Canyon. Drive 17 miles to Storm Castle Rd. between mile markers 66 and 65, and take a left, crossing the Storm Castle Bridge. Follow Storm Castle Rd. for 2 miles to the posted parking area.</p>

 <h2>Sypes Canyon Bike Tour</h2>

 </figure><br>
 <ul>    
    <li>Half Day Guide Charge - $75.00 </li>
    <li>Full Day Guide Charge - $100.00 </li>
    <li>Multi Day Guide Charge - $200.00 </li>
</ul>
<h3>About</h3>
     
 <p>This is a popular trail just north of Bozeman, near the southern end of the Bridger Range. The hike leads through a shaded forest following a creek-fed canyon (the stream is seasonal and usually dries up by mid-July). There's an overlook at 2 miles with a great view of the expansive Gallatin Valley; the trail continues up a long ridge and intersects with the Bridger Foothills Trail at 3.1 miles, providing further hiking, running, or biking options. Many hikers continue on to Mount Baldy, the prominent 8,914-foot summit visible from Bozeman.</p> 

 <h3>Seasonal Conditions</h3>
 <p>Sypes Canyon is most popular in late spring and summer, though it's usable year-round. Hike, run, or mountain bike during the spring, summer, and fall. Wear snowboots with grip action during winter. We only recommend cross-country skiing to experts, because there are steep climbs scattered throughout the trail.</p>

 <h3>Directions</h3>
 <p>From downtown Bozeman, head north on N. 7th, which turns into Frontage Rd. Turn right onto Springhill Rd., then turn right on Sypes Canyon Rd., and continue to the Y at the end of the road; bear right onto Churn Rd. and park at the signed trailhead. Overflow parking is available on Sypes Canyon Rd., just below the Y.</p>

   <p>Triple Tree Trail is a 5.4 mile moderately trafficked loop trail located near Bozeman, Montana that features beautiful wild flowers and is good for all skill levels. The trail offers a number of activity options and is best used from May until October. Dogs are also able to use this trail but must be kept on leash.</p>
       
   <h3>About</h3>
   <p>This trail is on the south side of Bozeman, close to town. The trail begins on a grassy spur, crosses Limestone Creek several times, and loops through state land on the northwest slope of Mount Ellis. Triple Tree is as a quick and easy local trail with lots of options and accessibility. There's a steep climb to an overlook, offering great views of the Gallatin Valley. </p>   
   <h3>Seasonal Conditions</h3>
   <p>Triple Tree can get very hot in late summer because it's only partially shaded; however, shade is plentiful in the switchbacks. Open year-round, the trail is best used from late spring (when it can still be muddy) through mid-fall. It's also a popular trail among cross-country skiers in the winter. </p>

   <h3>Directions</h3>
   <p>From downtown Bozeman, head west on W. Babcock St., then turn right onto S. Church Ave. Continue straight onto Sourdough Rd., and look for the signed parking lot on the left.</p>
